In this chapter, we will use the insights from the previous chapter, in order to extract meaningful samples from the dataset. At this point, we will use the BTCUSDT dataset from Binance. For simplicity purposes, before sampling, we will aggregate the data to the The algorithms responsible for sampling, can be used for other datasets as well, after finetuning the parameters associated with the functions that will be created.
